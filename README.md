# Classify the Weather and Predict the Unpredictable

This repository contains Python scripts for classifying weather conditions and predicting average temperatures using the XGBoost classifier and regressor, respectively. The scripts include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, cross-validation, and predicting values for submission datasets.

# Output

# Average Temperature Prediction
The script will output the RMSE scores for the model and generate a filled_sample_submission.csv file with the predicted average temperatures.

# Weather Condition Classification
The script will output the accuracy and classification report of the model on the test set. It will also generate a submission.csv file with the predicted weather conditions for the full dataset.
